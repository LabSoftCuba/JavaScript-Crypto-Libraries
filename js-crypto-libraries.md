## cryptico
https://github.com/wwwtyro/cryptico

An easy-to-use encryption system utilizing RSA and AES for javascript.

## pidCrypt
https://www.pidder.de/pidcrypt/?start

a JavaScript crypto library

## forge
https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge

A native implementation of TLS in Javascript and tools to write crypto-based and network-heavy webapps

* based on jsbn

JavaScript Cryptography Toolkit

This library is an object oriented cryptography toolkit that implements several
fundamental cryptographic algorithms including TWOFISH, SERPENT, RIJNDAEL, RSA
with key-generation and SHA(SHA-1,224,256,384,512) for JavaScript. This library
works in ActionScript as well. The unique feature of this library is
asynchronous processing. A heavyweight process such as 4096bit RSA key
generation will be done asynchronously so that this library does not cause
problems such as freezing browsers, "slow-downing" warning dialogs, etc.

* asynchronous RSA key generation

## jscrypto
http://code.google.com/p/jscryptolib/

A JavaScript Cryptography Library

This library is an object oriented cryptography library that implements several fundamental cryptographic algorithms including AES, SHA-1, HMAC, BASE64, RSA, ECC and IBE for JavaScript. This library works in ActionScript as well.

## Cifre
https://github.com/openpeer/cifre

Cifre is a fast crypto toolkit for modern client-side JavaScript. This is done by taking the best crypto code for js on the net and updating it to use modern technologies. There are plans to collaborate with the forge project.
